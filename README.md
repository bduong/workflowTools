For getting started info run<br/>
<b>java -jar workflow.jar</b>

The internal config file can be viewed at<br/>
<b>core/src/main/resources/internalConfig.json</b>

You can add a project specific config file to your repository by adding a file called<br/>
<b>.workflow-config.properties</b><br/>
in your projects root folder

You can add a user specific config file by adding a file called<br/>
<b>.workflow-config.properties</b><br/>
in your home folder

You can also specify a custom config file via two methods.<br/>
Specify -c [config file path] as a command line parameter.<br/>
Add a git configuration value for workflow.configFile.<br/>
<b>git config workflow.configFile [path to your config file]</b><br/>
That config file will then be used for every operation within that repository.

Config file values override values in the internalConfig.json file.<br/>
Only the values you want to override need to be specified in the new config file.

A list of alias commands that are worth adding to your ~/.bash_profile can be found in
<b>sampleConfig/aliasCommands.txt</b><br/>
Change the first line to match the directory where the workflow.jar is.

<b>FOR DEVELOPERS</b>

If you want to build the project use the following command<br/>
<b>mvn clean package -DskipTests</b><br/>
The built jar should be in core/target.

Running the tests in restApis requires updating the following file<br/>
<b>restApis/stc/test/resources/test.properties</b><br/>
The jenkins, reviewboard and jira urls in there should be changed to match your actual servers.
